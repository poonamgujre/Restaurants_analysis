Cognifyz Internship Project

Overview:-
This repository contains analyses performed during my remote internship at Cognifyz, where I explored a dataset of restaurants to derive insights related to various aspects of their operations and customer experiences. The primary focus areas included cuisine popularity, city-based restaurant analysis, pricing strategies,online delivery services, and review sentiments.

Project Objectives:-
The main objectives of this internship project were to:
Analyze restaurant data to provide insights into consumer preferences and behaviors.Develop visualizations to communicate findings effectively.Enhance skills in data analysis and presentation.

During my remote internship at Cognifyz, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of a restaurant dataset, focusing on several key aspects of the industry. I identified the top three most common cuisines and calculated their prevalence among the total number of restaurants. Additionally, I analyzed city-specific data to determine which city had the highest number of restaurants and assessed average ratings across cities. I visualized the distribution of restaurant price ranges and examined the percentage of establishments offering online delivery, comparing their average ratings to those without the service. The project also involved analyzing the distribution of restaurant ratings, common cuisine combinations, and geographic patterns of restaurant locations. I explored the presence and performance of restaurant chains, analyzed text reviews for positive and negative keywords, and investigated the relationship between review length and ratings. Lastly, I assessed the connection between price ranges and the availability of online delivery and table booking. This experience significantly enhanced my data analysis and visualization skills while providing valuable insights applicable to the restaurant industry

Technologies Used:-
(Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn,sklean ,plotly)
 SQL for database queries
Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization

Conclusion:-
This internship at Cognifyz allowed me to deepen my analytical skills, enhance my understanding of data visualization, and gain practical experience in real-world data analysis. The insights derived from this project can help inform strategic decisions in the restaurant industry.
