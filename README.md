Cognifyz Internship Project

Overview
This repository contains analyses performed during my remote internship at Cognifyz, where I explored a dataset of restaurants to derive insights related to various aspects of their operations and customer experiences. The primary focus areas included cuisine popularity, city-based restaurant analysis, pricing strategies,online delivery services, and review sentiments.
